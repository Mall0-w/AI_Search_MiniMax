current problems with mouse - jumping corners occurs sometimes
sometimes will legit just vanish into the void
mouse can teleport around map: ./MiniMax_search 2416 1 2 1 12 1

Think this has something to do with alpha/beta prunning and its effect on the path?

minimax prunning on root node, then just returning alpha

think jumping has to do with evaluations exceeding inital alpha/beta assignments however, this is still inconsistent behaviour between the
pruning / no pruning executions - don't know what could be causing this

TODO: replace all uses of DBL_MAX with some sort of constant cap (i used 5000)
    Make utility function continuous? (cat intersection should be mathematical min not an edge case)
    figure out what's causing odd pruning behaviour
